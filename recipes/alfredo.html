        <h2>Chicken Alfredo is a favorite for everyone. No one can resist the creamy taste of the pasta and chicken</h2>

        <p>This recipe is a great for one-pot pasta. If you feel like mixing it up, consider substituting heavy cream for milk to make a thicker sauce or swap chicken
            thighs for the breast
